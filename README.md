# Hi there, I'm Devaüëã

## üöÄ About Me

I am a recent graduate with a passion for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence engineering. I am certified as a [TensorFlow Developer](https://www.credential.net/a5c3602b-c7d3-4cce-a23c-fc1b0e2b53dc#gs.17fao6). I am eager to apply my academic knowledge and practical skills to real-world problems, aiming to make a meaningful impact through innovative solutions. I'm looking for my first job in the field of Data Science, Machine Learning, or AI engineering.

## üéì Education

- **Bachelor of Informatics Engineering**  
  Dian Nuswantoro University, 2024.
  Graduated with a GPA of 3.82, completing the program in 3.5 years with honors (Cum Laude).

## üìú Thesis

- **Title:** Emotion Recognition From E-Commerce Customer Reviews Using Transformer-Based Deep Learning
- **Description:** This research explores the application of a Transformer-based deep learning architecture to identify emotions from customer reviews in Indonesian-language e-commerce. Using a dataset of 5,400 customer reviews, the model is designed to classify five categories of emotions: Happy, Sadness, Anger, Love, and Fear. Performance evaluation using confusion matrix and precision, recall, and F1-score metrics provided insights into the model`s effectiveness in distinguishing complex emotions.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, TensorFlow, Keras, Google Colaboratory, Streamlit.

## üî≠ Projects

Here are a few highlights of the projects I have worked on:

### 1. **Travel Customer Prediction**
- **Description:** This is the final project from the Kampus Merdeka independent study program at Rakamin Academy's Data Science Bootcamp 2023. I led a team of 7 members to successfully complete this project. The focus of this project was on analyzing customer data to provide actionable recommendations for policy makers and marketing teams. Additionally, we developed a predictive model to identify potential customers likely to purchase a newly introduced vacation package.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Google Colaboratory, Streamlit.
- **GitHub Repository:** [-]

### 2. **Skin Disease Classification**
- **Description:** This project focuses on Skin Disease Image Classification using transfer learning with DenseNet121. As part of the "SkinSight" team for the Bangkit 2023 Capstone Project, I contributed to the development of the machine learning model. Our goal was to accurately classify various skin diseases, leveraging advanced deep learning techniques to aid in early detection and diagnosis.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Google Colaboratory, Flask.
- **GitHub Repository:** [-]
